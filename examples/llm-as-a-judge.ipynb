    "# LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluation with Flex-Evals\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate AI system outputs using the Flexible Evaluation Protocol (FEP). LLM-as-a-judge is particularly powerful for evaluating subjective qualities like helpfulness, accuracy, tone, and coherence that are difficult to capture with traditional programmatic checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why LLM-as-a-Judge?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional evaluation metrics work well for objective criteria (exact matches, thresholds, etc.), but many real-world AI applications need evaluation of subjective qualities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Helpfulness**: Is the response useful to the user?\n",
    "- **Accuracy**: Does the response contain correct information?\n",
    "- **Clarity**: Is the explanation easy to understand?\n",
    "- **Completeness**: Does the response fully address the question?\n",
    "- **Tone**: Is the response appropriate for the context?\n",
    "\n",
    "LLM-as-a-judge allows us to evaluate these nuanced criteria at scale while maintaining consistency and auditability."
