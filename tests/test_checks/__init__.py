"""
Test package for individual check implementations.

This package contains comprehensive tests for each check type,
organized by functionality rather than implementation details.
Each test module covers:

- Pydantic validation and field handling
- Execution logic and __call__ methods
- Engine integration tests
- Edge cases and error handling
- JSONPath integration tests

All tests preserve the existing functionality and test coverage
from the previous schema/implementation separation.
